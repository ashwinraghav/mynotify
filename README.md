Description
-----------

iNotify is a kernel-level API that allows user applications to monitor file system events.
iNotify can be used to monitor files and file directories.
Because iNotify works with the local GFS, it does not currently support NFS file/directory notifications.
MyNotify functions as an out-of-band extension to iNotify. By using a watcher server application on the NFS server, the client application is made aware of file system events on the NFS server.
